#again, I can comment out anything I want here

#you can use modules in perl like this
use strict;
use warnings;

#notice that you have to end each line with a semi-colon or you will get an error

#variables are declared like this in perl

my $var = "Hello (variable)";

#now we can print to STDOUT

print "Hello World\n";
print "$var World\n";
